## 3 questions I want to ask myself  when starting any react app


1) What information / data do I need in order for my applicatrion to work and/or exist?
    - this questions is analogous too determining the start of your project
        - exa of figuyring out the "state" of basketball:
            * players (at least 2 teams of players)
            * basketball 
            * basketball court
        
        - digital exa of figuring out the "state" of instagram 
            * users (profiles would be like the html representation of a user)
            * loggedin/ loggedout
            * photos / videos 

        - digital exa of figuring out the "state" of amazon 
            * products 
            * merchant sellers
            * users 

        1a) what data type would be the best to store your state?


2) How do I get that information in order for my app / store to exist?
    - this step is analogous to using fetching methods and useEffect


3) How do I want my users to visually see that information on my app?
    - this step is analogous to the return () statement of your React component
